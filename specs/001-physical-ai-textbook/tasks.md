# Tasks: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT required for this textbook project (static documentation site).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

All file paths start with `book/` per Constitution Principle VII (Operational Constraints).

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Project Verification & Dependencies)

**Purpose**: Verify existing Docusaurus project and install required dependencies

- [x] T001 Verify `book/` directory exists and contains valid Docusaurus project (`book/package.json`, `book/docusaurus.config.ts`)
- [x] T002 Install @docusaurus/theme-mermaid dependency in `book/` directory (`cd book && npm install @docusaurus/theme-mermaid`)
- [x] T003 [P] Delete default tutorial content at `book/docs/intro.md`
- [x] T004 [P] Delete default tutorial directory at `book/docs/tutorial-basics/`
- [x] T005 [P] Delete default tutorial directory at `book/docs/tutorial-extras/`

**Checkpoint**: Mermaid installed, default content removed, ready for configuration

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Configuration - Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Configure Docusaurus with Mermaid, dark mode, GitHub Pages, and navigation

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No content creation can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 Enable Mermaid in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - add `markdown: { mermaid: true }` and `themes: ['@docusaurus/theme-mermaid']`
- [x] T007 Configure dark mode as default in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - set `colorMode: { defaultMode: 'dark', disableSwitch: false, respectPrefersColorScheme: false }`
- [x] T008 Configure GitHub Pages deployment in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - update `url`, `baseUrl`, `organizationName`, `projectName`
- [x] T009 Update site metadata in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - change `title` to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" and `tagline` to course goal
- [x] T010 Update navbar in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - replace Tutorial/Blog with Module 1 and Module 2 links
- [x] T011 Update footer in `book/docusaurus.config.ts` - update links and copyright to Physical AI branding
- [x] T012 Update dark mode color scheme in `book/src/css/custom.css` - apply robotics/cyberpunk aesthetic colors
- [x] T013 Configure sidebars in `book/sidebars.ts` - setup autogenerated sidebars for module-01-ros2 and module-02-digital-twin
- [x] T014 Create Module 1 directory at `book/docs/module-01-ros2/`
- [x] T015 Create Module 2 directory at `book/docs/module-02-digital-twin/`
- [x] T016 Create Module 1 category metadata in `book/docs/module-01-ros2/_category_.json` with label "Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System"
- [x] T017 Create Module 2 category metadata in `book/docs/module-02-digital-twin/_category_.json` with label "Module 2: Digital Twin"
- [x] T018 Run build validation (`cd book && npm run build`) to verify Mermaid and configuration work

**Checkpoint**: Configuration complete - `npm run build` succeeds, dark mode default, navigation shows modules

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Landing page
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Module 1 content (can run parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 2 - Module 2 content (can run parallel with US1, US2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Phases 3-5 - Dark mode refinement
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Can run anytime after Phase 2 - Placeholders
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Landing page - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Module 1 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Module 2 - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Dark mode - Depends on content being present to verify
- **User Story 5 (P4)**: Placeholders - Can be done anytime

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different directories)
- T025, T026, T027 can run in parallel (different MDX files in Module 1)
- T029, T030, T031 can run in parallel (different MDX files in Module 2)
- US1, US2, US3 can start in parallel after Phase 2 completes

---

## Parallel Example: Module 1 Topics

```bash
# Launch all Module 1 topics together (different files, no dependencies):
Task T025: "Write Topic 1: ROS 2 Architecture in book/docs/module-01-ros2/01-architecture.mdx"
Task T026: "Write Topic 2: Python Agents in book/docs/module-01-ros2/02-python-agents.mdx"
Task T027: "Write Topic 3: Body Definition in book/docs/module-01-ros2/03-body-definition.mdx"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all content)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Landing Page)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Module 1)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test landing + Module 1 independently
6. Deploy MVP if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Configuration ready
2. Add User Story 1 (Landing) → Test → Deploy (Entry point live!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Module 1) → Test → Deploy (MVP with content!)
4. Add User Story 3 (Module 2) → Test → Deploy (Full scope!)
5. Add User Story 4 (Dark mode polish) → Test → Deploy
6. Add User Story 5 (Placeholders) → Final polish

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Phase 2 is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Landing Page)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Module 1 topics T025-T27)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Module 2 topics T029-T31)
3. Assessments done after topics complete
4. Dark mode refinement after all content

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- All file paths start with `book/` per Constitution Principle VII
- Each topic MDX must follow template in `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/contracts/topic-template.mdx`
- Each assessment MDX must follow template in `specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/contracts/assessment-template.mdx`
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently

---

**Total Tasks**: 43
**Tasks by User Story**:
- Setup: 5 tasks
- Foundational: 13 tasks
- US1 (Landing): 6 tasks
- US2 (Module 1): 4 tasks
- US3 (Module 2): 4 tasks
